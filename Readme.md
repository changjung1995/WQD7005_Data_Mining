In Milestone 1, I was crawled the price of cryptocurrencies from https://coinmarketcap.com/. The first 20 top cryptocurrencies was crawled by using Python BeautifulSoup. There are 6 columns exist in the dataset, which are close, high, low, open, volume and market capacity. The dataset was cleaned, and the data types were changed accordingly. Lastly, the cleaned dataset was save as csv files.
